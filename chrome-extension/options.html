        <p>
            Before adding your credentials, acknowledge the following things:
            <ol>
                <li>There is *NO* forgot password functionality.  If you forget your credentials then your backed up teams are gone.</li>
                <li>The credentials you enter here do not have to be the same as your credential in the <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokemon showdown app</a>.</li>
                <li>Infinite people can share the same username provided they have different passwords, the backed up teams, however, will not be shared</li>
                <li>This service makes no guarantees or warrantees or anything of the sort.  I will not not abuse or rely on this service for anything other than transient convenience.</li>
            </ol>
